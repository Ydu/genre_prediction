# Name That Genre
My project uses [Spotify's Audio Features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) and a Random Forest Classifier to predict the genre of a given song. 

The data gathering, model training, and some visualizations are included in first_genre_classification.ipynb, as well as some other work. Please see this file for the process I went through.
